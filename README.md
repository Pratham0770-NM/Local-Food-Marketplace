# Local-Food-Marketplace
This is a web-based digital marketplace that connects farmers and buyers directly. Each user selects their role, creates a profile, and interacts through dashboards â€” one for farmers and one for buyers. Both can store profiles, search for each other, and chat instantly. All data  is saved in localStorage, so it persists even after page reloads.
